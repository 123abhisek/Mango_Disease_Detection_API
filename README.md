# Mango Fruit Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project involves the development of a mobile application designed to help farmers and orchard owners quickly identify diseases in mango fruits. The application utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze images of mango fruits and provide accurate diagnoses of various diseases.

The scope of the project includes the creation of a user-friendly mobile app for Android platforms, which allows users to capture images of mango fruits. The app then processes these images through a backend machine learning model to detect and classify the presence of diseases.

The project aims to address the challenges faced in the mango industry due to diseases that affect crop quality and yield. By providing timely and accurate disease detection, the application helps in the effective management of mango crops, ensuring sustainable production.
